# Data Prepration Method 

As we mentioned in the report, we prepared the dataset on our end, using data from a variety of resources, which are cited in the paper itself. We did not use only Python but also ArcGIS, so it is not feasible for us to share the method in a notebook. It is also important to note that this work is part of an ongoing project that we plan to publish eventually.

To demonstrate the size of the data we worked with, one notebook is attached here, which processes a two-year Citi Bike dataset and shows that the data exceeds 7 million records.

The five percent sample data used in the notebooks, which were submitted for the project, is attached here for reference.
